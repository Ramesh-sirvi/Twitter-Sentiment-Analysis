# Twitter Sentiment Analysis — Full-Stack (FastAPI + Streamlit)

A two-tier version of the Twitter sentiment project: a **FastAPI
backend** that loads the fine-tuned BERT model once and serves
predictions over HTTP, and a **Streamlit frontend** that calls it. This
is the same model and preprocessing as the single-app version, split
so the model-serving layer and the UI can be deployed, scaled, and
updated independently — and so other clients (a mobile app, another
service, curl) can hit the same API.

## Option A — Run locally without Docker

**1. Backend**

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
unzip /path/to/bert_model.zip -d bert_model          # if not already there
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Check it's up: open `http://localhost:8000/health` — should show
`{"status": "ok", "device": "cpu"}` (or `"cuda"` if you have a GPU).
Interactive API docs are auto-generated at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

**2. Frontend** (in a second terminal)

```bash
cd frontend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

By default the frontend looks for the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.
Override with an environment variable if it's running elsewhere:

```bash
export SENTIMENT_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"   # set SENTIMENT_API_URL=... on Windows
```

## Option B — Run with Docker Compose

```bash
# put your unzipped model at backend/bert_model/ first
docker compose up --build
```

- Backend: `http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:8501`

Compose wires the frontend to reach the backend at `http://backend:8000`
automatically (Docker's internal DNS) — no manual `SENTIMENT_API_URL`
needed in this mode.

## API reference

| Method | Path             | Body                              | Returns                                                   |
|--------|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/health`        | –                                  | `{status, device}`                                          |
| POST   | `/predict`       | `{"text": "..."}`                 | `{sentiment, confidence, probabilities, cleaned_text}`       |
| POST   | `/predict/batch` | `{"texts": ["...", "..."]}` (≤256) | list of the above, one per input text                       |

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "I absolutely love this game!"}'
```

## Why split it this way

- **Independent scaling** — the model is the expensive part (memory,
  GPU); you can run several backend replicas behind a load balancer
  without duplicating the UI, or scale the frontend independently
  since it's lightweight.
- **Reusable API** — any client (a different frontend, a notebook, a
  script, another team's service) can call `/predict` directly instead
  of going through Streamlit.
- **Cleaner deploys** — the backend and frontend can live in separate
  containers/services (e.g. backend on a GPU instance, frontend on a
  small always-on web dyno) and be redeployed independently.

## Notes

- Preprocessing, label ordering, and the "why the original app.py's
  cleaning didn't match training" fix are unchanged from the single-app
  version — see `backend/preprocessing.py`. Run `python
  test_preprocessing.py` inside `backend/` to sanity-check it.
- `bert_model/` (~420MB) is deliberately not shipped in the Docker build
  context by default in this README — for a real deployment, pull it
  from object storage (S3/GCS) or Git LFS at build/start time rather
  than baking it into the image, unless your registry/host is fine
  with a large image.
- The batch endpoint currently runs texts through the model one at a
  time in a Python loop rather than as a single padded batch — simpler
  and safe for typical CSV sizes; if you're pushing thousands of rows
  regularly, batch the tokenizer/model calls together for more speed.

# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using BERT

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that performs **multi-class sentiment classification** on Twitter text using **BERT (bert-base-uncased)** and the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model classifies tweets into four sentiment categories: **Positive**, **Negative**, **Neutral**, and **Irrelevant**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end NLP pipeline for Twitter sentiment analysis, including:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Text tokenization using BERT tokenizer
- Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model
- Model evaluation using standard classification metrics
- Sentiment prediction on unseen tweets

The project is implemented in **Python** using **Google Colab**, **PyTorch**, and the **Hugging Face Transformers** library.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess Twitter text
